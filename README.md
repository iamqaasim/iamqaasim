<summary> <h2> üë®‚Äçüíª iamqaasim's Coding Journey </h2> </summary>
  From a young age, I possessed a curious mind and enjoyed building and creating things. My aspirations initially centered around becoming an inventor, which later developed into a passion for science and technology. Initially, I wanted to pursue engineering since it was the closest field to invention. However, due to circumstances, I ended up pursuing a degree in Data Science instead. While analyzing data intrigued me, I felt like something was missing. <br /> <br />

  Towards the end of my degree, the pandemic struck and I found myself with plenty of free time. Rather than waste it, I decided to teach myself coding. However, being a complete novice to programming, I had no idea where to begin. Thankfully, some of my Computer Science friends provided guidance and I learned Python through YouTube videos and free online courses. Through this process, I developed a secondary interest in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). <br />

  In the pursuit of these newfound interests, I realized that I lacked an outlet for my creative side. Within a few weeks, I used my Python skills to enhance my studies, which led to exponential improvements in my marks. This spurred me to seek out further knowledge, even to the point of considering pursuing a second degree in Computer Science or Robotics. But, then I discovered an online Software Engineering program that offered a free year-long course. I applied and was accepted on the same day. <br />

  Since joining this program, I have gained extensive knowledge about programming, its applications, how computers work, the internet's infrastructure, and much more. Moving forward, I intend to continue my journey and hope to specialize in the field of ML and AI development. <br />
