**`Data Scientist & Software Enigineer`**

Hello World!!! 👋 

i'm a Data Scientist and Software Engineer, building my version of the digital world one program at a time. All coding projects are built from the ground up, from planning and testing all the way to solving real-world problems with code. My passion for creating and analysing lead me to where I am now and hopefully it will progress me closer towards the field of Machine Learining and Artificial Intelligence.

 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 iamqaasim's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
  At a young age I had a curious mind, I enjoyed building and creating things. My dream was to become an 'inventor'. This later matured into a passion for  Science, Technology. Initially I wanted to become an engineer of some sort, because its the closest thing to being an inventor. However my circumstances lead me towards pursuing a degree in Data Sciene instead. Althought analysing data is an insterest of mine I felt like there was something missing.
  
<br />
  
  During the end of my degree the pandemic hit and I was stuck at home with lots of free time so instead of sitting around doing nothing I decided to teach myself coding. I started learning python and over time I realsied that the thing i felt was missing in my life was my creative side.
  
  I started my coding journey as a naive science student with a passion to learn everything I could about this world of science and technology - code, unix, linux, theory. As a high schooler my plan was to become an Engineer but interest lead me towards Data Science instead. Althought I do enjoy the field I always felt like there was something missing. During my final year of univerity I figured I start teaching myself programming through YouTube videos. During this time it reignited my passion for creating things so I started looking for online courses and programs. I came across a year program for Software Engineering by ALX - its a program deddicated to people around Africa. After joining this program I've learnt so much with regards to how a computer works, the logic used to create programs, team work as well as understanding the full spectrum of programming. This program really excelled my long term goal of becoming a AI Software Engineer.
