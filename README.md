<summary> <h2> üë®‚Äçüíª iamqaasim's Coding Journey </h2> </summary>
  At a young age I had a curious mind, I enjoyed building and creating things. My dream was to become an 'inventor'. This later matured into a passion for  Science, Technology. Initially I wanted to become an engineer of some sort, because its the closest thing to being an inventor. However my circumstances lead me towards pursuing a degree in Data Sciene instead. Althought analysing data is an insterest of mine I felt like there was something missing. <br /> <br />
  
  During the end of my degree the pandemic hit and I was stuck at home, with lots of free time. So instead of sitting around doing nothing I decided to teach myself coding, but as a complete stranger to programing I had no clue where to start. I talked to some of my Computer Science friends and I ended up learning python through YouTube videos and free online courses. Ater which I picked up a secondary interest in machine Learning (ML) as as Artificial intelligence (AI). <br />
  
  In pursuit of this new found interests I realised that the thing I was missing was having an outlet for my creative side. Within a few weeks I used python skills to help me in my studies, which improved my marks exponentially. After which I was so eager to learn more that I considered pursuing a 2nd degree in Computer Science or Robotics, but then I came across an online Software Engineering programe. It was a free year program which I thought was a good idea to do part time while I work. I applied and got accepted the same day. <br />
  
  After joining this program I've learnt so much about how to write code, the application of programing, how computers work, the infrastructure behind the internet and much more. I intend to continue my journy forward in hopes to push towards the field of ML and AI development. <br />
